These scripts run a set of tests against a remote machine.

The idea is to test the durability guarantees of WiredTiger by
hard crashing the remote machine regularly, and validating
that the database after the crash is reasonable.

The scripts are:

pt_config - Contains configuration settings and shared functionality
pt_local_setup.sh - Script to run to get the environment configured.
pt_local_run.sh - Script to run to power cycle the machines.

pt_remote_setup.sh - used by the local script - don't run it.
pt_remote_run.sh - used by the local script - don't run it.

The scripts currently work with a virtual machine running locally in an LCX
container.
